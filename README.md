Because I wanted a **reliable and transparent way** to share my projects.  
This repo is:  
- A **portfolio for humans** (explore my work).  
- A **knowledge base for agents** (structured Markdown, metadata, and context).  
- A **source of truth** for my website, which consumes these files and presents them visually.
