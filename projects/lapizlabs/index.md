## Overview

Lapiz Labs was an educational startup I founded with Laura Prieto and Diana Martin in July 2023. The company specialized in providing robotics and programming education to children and adolescents using LEGO Education methodology through both group and individual in-person classes. After 8 months of operation, we made the strategic decision to close the company in February 2024.

## My Contribution

As co-founder and operational leader, I took responsibility for the core business operations and educational content development:

- **Operations Management**: Coordinated instructor schedules, managed student enrollment, and oversaw day-to-day business operations
- **Curriculum Development**: Created learning materials and structured educational pathways for different age groups and skill levels
- **Team Building**: Recruited and trained a team of 5 university student instructors, including myself
- **Competition Preparation**: Developed specialized training programs for students participating in robotics competitions
- **Database Management**: Designed and maintained a comprehensive Notion database system for tracking students, parents, classes, and educational content

## Process

</p>

The company operated with a clear educational philosophy centered on learning through play. We offered two main service formats:

**Group Classes**: Interactive sessions with up to 8 students per instructor, focused on collaborative learning and teamwork development. Children worked through structured learning paths that covered logical thinking, mathematics concepts, programming fundamentals, and motor skills development.

</p>

**Individual Classes**: Personalized home-based instruction where instructors visited students' homes to provide tailored educational experiences. Each session was carefully planned and customized to the student's learning pace and interests.

We maintained detailed documentation of every class, including instructor feedback, student progress, and educational materials used. This systematic approach allowed us to continuously improve our methodology and track student development effectively.

## Architecture / Stack

**Educational Equipment**:
- 3 LEGO Spike Essential and Prime kits (our primary teaching platform)
- 5 alternative robotics kits from various manufacturers for diversified learning
- 4 basic electronics kits for foundational circuit understanding

**Operational Systems**:
- **Notion Database**: Comprehensive system for managing student information, parent contacts, class schedules, instructor assignments, and educational content
- **Curriculum Framework**: Structured learning paths based on LEGO Education methodology, adapted for Colombian educational context
- **Quality Control**: Systematic class documentation including lesson plans, materials used, and instructor feedback

**Team Structure**:
- 3 Co-founders (including myself)
- 5 University student instructors (including co-founders)
- Clear operational roles and responsibilities distribution

## Results

Over 8 months of operation, Lapiz Labs successfully established itself as a quality STEM education provider for children:

**Student Impact**:
- Over 40 total students served across both individual and group formats
- Maintained a consistent base of 10 active students in group classes and 8 in individual instruction
- Approximately 80 classes delivered across all formats
- Measurable improvement in students' logical thinking, programming skills, and teamwork abilities

**Operational Success**:
- Built and managed a reliable team of 5 instructors
- Developed a scalable curriculum and operational framework
- Created systematic processes for class planning, delivery, and quality control
- Established strong relationships with parents and demonstrated educational value

**Business Learning**:
The experience provided invaluable insights into educational entrepreneurship, team management, curriculum development, and the challenges of scaling an educational services business. While the company ultimately closed, the systematic approach to operations and education delivery created a solid foundation that could be replicated in future educational ventures.

The decision to close was strategic, allowing the founding team to apply lessons learned to new opportunities while maintaining the positive impact we had on our students' STEM education journey.
