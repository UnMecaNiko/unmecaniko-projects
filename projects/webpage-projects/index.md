## Overview

This project presents an automated portfolio management system that combines AI-powered documentation with structured knowledge repositories. The system enables automatic creation and maintenance of project entries on a personal website through the use of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, AI agents, and standardized markdown templates.

The solution addresses the common challenge of maintaining an up-to-date portfolio by creating a workflow where project documentation is automatically consumed from a GitHub repository and rendered dynamically on a website. The system features intelligent content creation through AI agents that can generate new project entries following predefined templates and organizational standards.

## My Contribution

I designed and implemented the entire automated system from conception to deployment. This included:

- **Architecture Design**: Created a structured repository system with clear documentation standards
- **MCP Server Development**: Built custom MCP tools using n8n workflows that connect to GitHub APIs
- **AI Integration**: Developed context files and templates that guide AI agents in creating project entries
- **Website Integration**: Implemented automatic content consumption from markdown files to dynamic web pages

## Process

For months, I had been thinking about organizing my projects in a common placeâ€”a site where anyone could enter and see photos, videos, check the repository, and get all the details. In 2020, I created a Facebook page, but its reach wasn't what I expected, and I couldn't reach the audience I wanted. Then I naturally started sharing everything on LinkedIn, where people could see it, interact with the content, and check it whenever they wanted. But it didn't look so organized, so I knew it: I had to create a website, first as an engineering exercise and mainly to organize my portfolio.

I first tried with a WordPress server and had an acceptable first iteration, but when I started uploading content, it felt very manual, and I couldn't find a way to automate it.

Later, learning more about MCP servers, agents, and context, I learned about how software development processes should be documented with AI development in mind. Applying this new knowledge, I wanted to bring this to my websiteâ€”it was exactly what I needed: a knowledge base that any service could consume.

I created a repository with a clear structure where all my project information is stored and created a special context folder that explains how this repository is organized and gives instructions to agents so they can create new entries. In fact, this post was created from a Copilot prompt that connects to an MCP tool that accesses the context repositories.

The website automatically consumes content from the index.md files, detects when there's a new folder in `/projects/` and creates one more thumbnail on the main page that when clicked takes you to the page with all the project details.

## Architecture / Stack

The system follows a structured approach with clear separation of concerns:

**Repository Structure:**
```
/projects-portfolio-repo
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # Global index of the repository
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ /projects # One folder per project, each with index.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ izy/
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ domichat/
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.md
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ /context
  â”œâ”€â”€ repository-context.md
  â”œâ”€â”€ about-unmecaniko.md
  â””â”€â”€ project-template.md
```

**MCP Server Implementation:**
The MCP server is an n8n trigger that connects as a tool to a sub-workflow that queries information directly from GitHub. This enables AI agents to access repository context and create new project entries automatically.

**Key Components:**
- **Context Files**: Provide structured guidance for AI agents and humans
- **Project Templates**: Ensure consistency across all project documentation
- **Automated Detection**: Website automatically discovers new projects
- **Media Management**: External storage via Supabase for images and YouTube for videos

## Results

The system successfully automated the project documentation process and eliminated manual content management workflows. Key achievements include:

- **Automated Content Creation**: AI agents can now create project entries following structured templates
- **Dynamic Website Updates**: New projects automatically appear on the website without manual intervention  
- **Consistent Documentation**: All projects follow the same structured format and metadata standards
- **Scalable Architecture**: The system can handle an unlimited number of projects with minimal maintenance

**Future Improvements:**
- Create an agent that researches projects more deeply, extracting information from LinkedIn
- Add Supabase connection for automated photo uploads
- Improve index.md creation accuracy - agents sometimes forget metadata or deviate from structure
- Implement project filtering by categories on the landing page
- Add more historical projects to the portfolio

The system represents a significant improvement over manual content management, providing a foundation for scalable portfolio growth and automated documentation processes. ðŸš€
