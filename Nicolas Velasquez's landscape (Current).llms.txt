# 1. Introduction

This document describes the Nicolas Velasquez's landscape software architecture using the [C4 model](c4model.com) methodology export generated by [IcePanel](icepanel.io) at 2025-09-17 00:32:09.

I've included a description of each C4 model hierarchy level and object type that we will be referencing in this document.

Level 1 of the C4 model is the context level and shows business value provided to your users.
Level 2 of the C4 model is the container or app level and shows deployable/runnable objects in a system
Level 3 of the C4 model is the component level and shows code structure within apps/stores
An actor is a person that gets value from your system(s), lives at level 1 of the C4 model and is sometimes referred to as people or users.
A system is a group of apps/stores, often owned by a team, lives at level 1 of the C4 model and is sometimes referred to as a software system.
A group is a visual grouping or separation of objects and can live at any level of the C4 model.
An app is a deployable and/or runnable service or client, lives at level 2 of the C4 model and is referred to as a container in the C4 model.
A store is a database or storage bucket, lives at level 2 of the C4 model and is referred to as a container in the C4 model.
A component is a building block of an app/store and lives at level 3 of the C4 model
IcePanel does not use level 4 of the C4 model.
IcePanel adds an extra level 0 at the start of the C4 model called domains that are used to separate the software architecture into high level business or logical areas
